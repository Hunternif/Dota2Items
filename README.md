Dota 2 Items
============

Dota 2 Items Mod aims to recreate items from Dota 2 in Minecraft with the same look-and-feel (16 pixel Minecraft style). That includes **textures, sounds, particle effects, cooldown, charges, usage mechanics** redesigned to suit Minecraft, and, of course, **item crafting**.

This mod should be single player and multiplayer compatible.

See the wiki for more.

Building
--------

Link the `src` folder as source to your project build path. In order to build and package the mod fore release run the script `build.bat`. The script must be run in its current directory and the environment variable `FORGE_HOME` must point to Minecraft Forge install directory. Additionally, the mod will be packaged into an archive (with resources and mcmod.info) only if you have WinRAR installed at default path.

Hope someone provides a cleaner solution :)
