Dota 2 Items
============

Dota 2 Items Mod aims to recreate items from Dota 2 in Minecraft with the same look-and-feel (16 pixel Minecraft style). That includes **textures, sounds, particle effects, cooldown, charges, usage mechanics** redesigned to suit Minecraft, and, of course, **item crafting**.

This mod should be single player and multiplayer compatible.
