Dota2Items
==========

Dota 2 Items Mod aims to recreate items from Dota 2 in Minecraft with the same look-and-feel (16 pixel Minecraft style). That includes **textures, sounds, particle effects, cooldown, charges, usage mechanics** redesigned to suit Minecraft, and, of course, **item crafting**.

Dota 2 Items are not dropped on death, and when you respawn you receive all of Dota 2 Items you had before dying. Passive effects are accumulated from all 10 items currently in your inventory hot bar.

This mod should be single player and multiplayer compatible.

In future I will probably make the Dota 2 merchant NPC in villages and in forests. And you will get gold for killing mobs and other players as wells as at a constant but slow rate, like in Dota.
