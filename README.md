Dota 2 Items
============

Dota 2 Items Mod aims to recreate items from Dota 2 in Minecraft with the same look-and-feel (16 pixel Minecraft style). That includes **textures, sounds, particle effects, cooldown, charges, usage mechanics** redesigned to suit Minecraft, and, of course, **item crafting**.

This mod should be single player and multiplayer compatible.

See the wiki for more.

Building
--------

LibSchematic sources have to be copied to `mcp/src/minecraft`. To obtain the sources, refer to this repo: https://github.com/tehbeard/LibSchematic

Link the `src` folder as source to your project build path. In order to build and package the mod for release run the script `build.bat`. The script must be run in its current directory and the environment variable `MCP_HOME` must point to MCP install directory. (If you only install Minecraft Forge, then its's in forge/mcp.)

TODO: make a better building solution using Ant.
